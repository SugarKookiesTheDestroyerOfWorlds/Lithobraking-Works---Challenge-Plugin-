Have Fun (or pain) Trying to beat this stupid challenge.

6. s u f f e r

7. If they relase a new version, and it doesn't work. God help ya'. I'm not suffering through trying to remake this plugin with the utter lack of documantaion and my lack of coding experience in C#. I'm only really fluent in Lua
8. WHY IS THERE NO RESOURCES FOR KSP MODDING?!?!?!?!? OTHER THEN THE HALF BAKED OFFICAL DOCUMANTION WHERE HALF OF THE FUNCTIONS HERE ARE MISSING INFOMATION ON WHAT THEY EVEN DO!!!!!! THIS IS LITERLY MY FIRST ATTEMPT TRYING TO CODE IN C#!
9. Well, this turned into a rant. Thanks for downloading! 
10. If anyone knows how to decompile KSP plugins, please don't look at my C# scripting. It's a mess. :/
